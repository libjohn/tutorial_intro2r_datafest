However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

    "text": "Visualize, wrangle, and summarize\nHere I’m using this State of Ultra Running report as a model to demonstrate some of the capabilities of R / Tidyverse\n\njoin datasets\n\nJoin, Assign, and Pipe\nIn this case I want to join the two data frames rank_df and race_df using the left_join() function.\nI can assign the output of a “data pipe” (i.e. data sentence) to use in subsequent code-chunks. A common R / Tidyverse assignment operator is the <- characters. You can read this as “gets value from”.\nAdditionally, I’m using a pipe operator (|>) as a conjunction to connect functions. In this way I can form a data sentence. Many people call the data sentence a data pipe, or just a pipe. You may see another common pipe operator: %>%. \\> and %>% are synonymous.\nusing dplyr::left_join() I combine the two data sets and then use {ggplot2} to create a line graph of participants by year.\n\nmy_df_joined <- rank_df |> \n  left_join(race_df, by = \"race_year_id\") |>\n  mutate(my_year = lubridate::year(date))\n\n\n\n\nViz participants\nLet’ make a quick line plot showing how many people participate in races each year. Here we have a date field this is also a date data-type. Data types are important and in this example using a data data-type means {ggplot2} will simplify our x-axis labels.\nHere we use the {lubridate} package to help manage my date data-types. We also use {ggplot2} to generate a line graph as a time series via the {ggplot2} package and a geom_line() layer. Note that {ggplot2} uses the ‘+’ as the conjunction or pipe.\n\nrank_df |> \n  left_join(race_df |> select(race_year_id, date), by = \"race_year_id\") |>\n  mutate(my_year = lubridate::year(date)) |> \n  count(my_year, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby distance\nHere I use count() in different ways to see what I can see. I comment out each attempt before settling on summarizing a table of total country participants by year.\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(participation = str_to_lower(participation)) |> \n  # count(participation, sort = TRUE)\n  # count(city) |> \n  # count(race) |> \n  count(my_year, country, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 333 × 3\n   my_year country           n\n     <dbl> <chr>         <int>\n 1    2019 United States  7735\n 2    2018 United States  6994\n 3    2018 France         6511\n 4    2019 France         6449\n 5    2017 United States  6397\n 6    2017 France         5470\n 7    2014 United States  5384\n 8    2015 United States  4990\n 9    2016 United States  4984\n10    2013 United States  4481\n# … with 323 more rows\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(participation = str_to_lower(participation)) |> \n  count(my_year, country, sort = TRUE) |> \n  drop_na(country) |> \n  mutate(country = fct_lump_prop(country, prop = .03)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = country))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby country\nI used fct_lump_prop() in the previous code-chunk to lump the country variable into categories by frequency. Here we refine the categories into specific levels. We are still mutating the country variable as a categorical factor; this time using the fct_other() function of {forcats} with some pre-defined levels (see the my_levels vector in the code-chunk below).\n\nmy_levels <- c(\"United States\", \"France\", \"United Kingdom\", \"Spain\")\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(country = fct_other(country, keep = my_levels)) |> \n  count(my_year, country, sort = TRUE) |> \n  drop_na(country) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n, color = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry race-host\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  drop_na(country) |> \n  mutate(country = fct_lump_n(country, n = 7)) |>\n  count(country, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = fct_reorder(country, n))) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationality of runner\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(nationality = fct_lump_n(nationality, n = 7)) |> \n  count(nationality, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(nationality, n))) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique participants\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  distinct(my_year, runner) |> \n  count(my_year) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant frequency separated by gender\nNote the use of count, if_else, as.character, and group_by to transform the data for visualizing. Meanwhile, the visual bar graph is a proportional graph with the y-axis label by percentage. We do this by manipulating the plot scales. Scales are also used to choose colors from a predefined palette (i.e. “Dark2”.) Findally, we facet the plot by gender (See facet_wrap()).\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  count(my_year, gender, runner, sort = TRUE) |> \n  mutate(n_category = if_else(n >= 5, \"more\", as.character(n))) |> \n  group_by(my_year) |> \n  mutate(total_races = sum(n)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, total_races))  +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(n_category)), position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(gender)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPace per mile\nWe want to calculate a value for each runner’s pace (i.e. minute_miles). We have to create and convert a character data-type of the time variable into a numeric floating point (or dbl) data-type so that we can calculate pace (i.e. race-minutes divided by distance.) These data transformations required a lot of manipulation as I was thinking through my goal. I could optimized this code, perhaps. However it works and I’ve got other things to do. Do I care if the CPU works extra hard? No, not in this case.\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(time_hms = str_remove_all(time, \"[HMS]\"), .after = time) |> \n  mutate(time_hms = str_replace_all(time_hms, \"\\\\s\", \":\")) |> \n  separate(time_hms, into = c(\"h\", \"m\", \"s\"), sep = \":\") |> \n  mutate(bigminutes = (\n    (as.numeric(h) * 60) + as.numeric(m) + (as.numeric(s) * .75)\n    ), .before = h) |> \n  mutate(pace = bigminutes / distance, .before = bigminutes) |> \n  drop_na(pace, distance, my_year) |> \n  filter(distance > 0,\n         pace > 0) |> \n  group_by(my_year, gender) |>  \n  summarise(avg_pace = mean(pace), max_pace = max(pace), min_pace = min(pace)) |> \n  pivot_longer(-c(my_year, gender), names_to = \"pace_type\")  |> \n  separate(value, into = c(\"m\", \"s\"), remove = FALSE) |> \n  mutate(h = \"00\", .before = m) |> \n  mutate(m = str_pad(as.numeric(m), width = 2, pad = \"0\")) |> \n  mutate(s = str_pad(round(as.numeric(str_c(\"0.\",s)) * 60), width = 2, pad = \"0\")) |> \n  unite(minute_miles, h:s, sep = \":\") |> \n  mutate(minute_miles = hms::as_hms(minute_miles)) |> \n  # drop_na(gender) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, minute_miles)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = pace_type), size = 1) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(gender))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'my_year'.

A good plot will need refinement with some or all of these functions.\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(age_cut = cut_width(age, width = 10, boundary = 0), .after = age) |> \n  count(age_cut, gender, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 23 × 3\n   age_cut gender     n\n   <fct>   <chr>  <int>\n 1 (40,50] M      48325\n 2 (50,60] M      30175\n 3 (30,40] M      25480\n 4 (40,50] W       8630\n 5 (60,70] M       7593\n 6 (30,40] W       5450\n 7 (50,60] W       5179\n 8 (20,30] M       3121\n 9 [0,10]  M       1211\n10 (60,70] W        904\n# … with 13 more rows\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  filter(age < 80) |> \n  drop_na(gender) |> \n  ggplot(aes(y = cut_width(age, width = 10, boundary = 0))) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = gender)) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(gender))\n\n\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  filter(age < 70, age >= 20) |>\n  drop_na(gender) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_rev(cut_width(age, width = 10, boundary = 0))), position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Age\", title = \"Age distribution of ultra runners\",\n       caption = \"Source: ITRA > Benjamin Nowak > Tidy Tuesday\",\n       x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", plot.title.position = \"plot\") + \n  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))"
